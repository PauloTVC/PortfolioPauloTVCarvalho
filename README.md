# Portfolio Paulo T. V. de Carvalho

Hello,

I am an R&D engineer with a strong focus on mechanical design and robotics. My journey in this field began during my undergraduate studies in Mechanical Engineering, where I not only stood out academically but also actively participated as a monitor and a key member of the robotics team, Riobotz. Within Riobotz, I immersed myself in the world of mechanical design and construction, eventually taking on the role of the team's principal designer.

Currently, I am pursuing my master's degree, where I have embraced a new set of challenges. These include expanding my skill set to include programming, exploring the intricacies of quadruped robots, and continuing to engage in exciting design projects, including contributions to the Robotics Lab (Labrob) of PUC-Rio and other initiatives.
